# ssw-additional-checks
This plugin provides additional checks a super admin can customize before displaying [Site Setup Wizard](https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-setup-wizard/)'s steps to a user.

You can customize it based on your needs and perform any form of additional checks you may require from a user before allowing him to proceed with the Site Setup Wizard. 

As an example I have created a function ssw_limit_no_of_sites() which performs a check and does NOT allow a user to create more than 1 site in the system.
